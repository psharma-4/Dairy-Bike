# DairyBike Project - eYRC 2021

The **DairyBike** project is a simulation-based implementation of a self-balancing delivery bike, designed to autonomously pick up and deliver dairy products in a virtual cityscape.

## ðŸš² Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a **two-wheeled self-balancing robot** equipped with a **robotic arm** to perform pickups and deliveries. The bike navigates autonomously through the arena, handling delivery orders based on package priorityâ€”posing a challenging **path planning** and **control systems** problem.

### ðŸ§  Key Features

- **Self-Balancing Mechanism** using a **reaction wheel** controlled by a **Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)**.
- **Dynamics derived using** the **Euler-Lagrange Method**.
- **Autonomous Navigation** with delivery prioritization.
- **Pickup & Delivery System** controlled through **inverse kinematics**.
- Fully simulated in a 3D environment using **CoppeliaSim**.
